# Project-class-12
Class 12 Capstone Project

About:
This was our Final Capstone Project for 12th Grade in the Python Programming Course.
My 2 friends and I put to use everything we learnt in python over the course of 2 years and also used pygame and its modules to make an online copy of a game called "Hunter Assasin", which is a single player fps game.
This was an year long project, we integrated tkinter as a UI component for logging in for the users and displaying the leaderboard, we also used sql to store the user data from the game.
All in all this was a fun project to work on, even though it was hard, I felt a sense of accomplishment.
This will always be one of my favourite projects as it is my first big project!
